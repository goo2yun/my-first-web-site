  <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>

    target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">htpertext markup language(HTML)</a> is the standard markup language
  gor <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications
  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by 
  the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.

  </p><p style="margin-top:40px;"></p>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less 
  normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
  content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop 
  publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their 
  default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many 
  web sites still in their infancy.Various versions have evolved over 
  the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose 
  (injected humour and the like).
